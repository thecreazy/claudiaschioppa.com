    "description": "I’m a 27-year-old Argentinian-Italian web designer and frontend developer living in Buenos Aires and looking forward to moving to Europe or USA. I’m a really curious person, and in spite of having a university degree, I consider myself a self-taught person constantly learning and always looking for new things to improve. \n Besides my passion for design and coding, I love and spend a lot of time travelling and taking photos. Feel free to visit my Unsplash page. \n My main focus nowadays is emotional design, web animation, and accessibility.",
